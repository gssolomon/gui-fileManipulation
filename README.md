This is the python program which does all the work on the basis of all the requirements provided.

The gui is such that it has 4 images at the corners.
It accepts 2 text fields namely first and last name.

It opens a file having last and first names named "WithoutMe.txt".
The entered last and first name is stored in this opened file in sorted manner and this new file is stored by the name "WithMe.txt".

At the end it also displays all the 'sorted' items of the file in the GUI.
